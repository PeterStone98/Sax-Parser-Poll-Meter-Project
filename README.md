# Sax-Parser-Poll-Meter-Project
A Java Program for a theoretical poll meter reading system. The main class takes an input file containing customers names, addresses, and acount information and uses a custom made Handler which made use of a SAX parser to seperate all of this data and build a database. The handler could then be manipulated to edit or display account information when promted.

Each account class could contain different types of properties and utilized Java's inhertince function to add various subclasses.
